                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to Margaritaville Capitola! Our restaurant has been welcoming guests to Capitola for over 30 years. In January 2015 the original owners sold the business to Sunset Hospitality Group, a Santa Cruz family owned and operated company. We completed a full remodel of the restaurant, reinvented the food and service and opened May 7, 2015.</p>
                    <p>The new Margaritaville is dedicated to serving made from scratch Mexican seafood in a first class casual environment. Our dog-friendly heated patio is a great place to enjoy Baja fish tacos and raw oysters on the half shell. Our chile verde and chicken mole enchiladas are rooted in tradition. In addition we take pride in serving a variety of handcrafted margaritas made with fresh juice and local produce.</p>
                    <p>Sunset Hospitality is grateful for the support of Capitola and looks forward to serving the community and visitors for years to come.</p>
